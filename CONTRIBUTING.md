# Contributing

Solo project — these conventions exist so `git log --graph` stays readable and the work-tracker extension has a stable contract to enforce.

## Branch Convention

```
feat/<name>    new extension, tool, or capability
fix/<name>     bug fix
chore/<name>   config, docs, cleanup (no behavior change)
```

- `main` = stable. Direct commits only for trivial one-liners (typo, single-line comment).
- Every piece of real work gets a branch, even solo.
- Merge with `--no-ff` to preserve branch topology: `git merge --no-ff feat/<name>`
- Delete branch after merge: `git branch -d feat/<name>`
- Tag milestones on `main`: `v<major>.<minor>.0`

## Example Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feat/notes-patch
# ... do work, commit ...
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feat/notes-patch
git branch -d feat/notes-patch
git push origin main
```
